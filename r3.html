     <h1>Reading 3</h1>
       <h3>
       Q1: From the Manovich reading, give 2 examples of interface or interactions with a piece of technology that has a performative action or theatrical behavior. This is in context with the ideas credited to Brenda Laurel that Lev mentions in the article. They can be electronic/digital or analog but NOT a computer or smart phone. Explain why these are good examples.
       </h3>
       <p>
       One example of a piece of tech that has an interface that causes a performative action is a cash register. Although most places use a computer as a cash register these days, they essentially perform the same task as an older cash register. The programming of a cash register is made to take much work off the cashier. There is also programming to open the drawer.
       </p>
       <h3>
       Q2: Also From the Manovich reading, he uses the term Gesamtkunstwerk. What does this term mean and how is using it to refer to the aestheticization of information tools?
       </h3>
       <p>
       Gesamtkunstwerk directly engages the three senses of sight, hearing and touch, and evoking the fourth sense of taste through the phone's name and color. Manovich uses the LG Chocolate phone as an example. The phone completely changes once the user opens it. The screen displays animations, plays a sound, and vibrates for an interaction that stimulates multiple senses.
       </p>
       <h3>
       Q3. From the RadioLab Podcast, the guest podcast artist is sharing his radio show called 99% invisible. The first piece is about sound design. What would you describe the role of the sound designer and how does it relate to this idea of theatre and performance?
       </h3>
       <p>
       A sound designer works behind the scenes to create everything we hear in a production. Sound designers are trained artists that have an understanding of how various mixes of sounds can evoke different feelings.
       </p>
       <h3>
       Q4. From the Skeuomorphism vs. Flat Design article, what are the philosophical and visual differences between Skeuomorphism vs. Flat Design and how might this also relate to this idea of theatre and gamification described in the Lev Article?
       </h3>
       <p>
       Skeuomorphism, in a way, tricks a person into thinking that one thing is another. Skeuomorphism has an illusionistic affect. In product design, this is used to make the consumer feel more comfortable when their brain sees images that are familiar. Flat design is very 2D. The plain interface of flat deign makes it easier for some consumers to understand.
       </p>
       <h3>
       Q5. Based on the Manovich reading, and following up on Q.1 ., As a group, find the images of 2 different examples of technologies that embodies for you the authors idea of how interfaces to early electronics or machine systems were designed in the past. Specifically look for examples from 1950's,60's, and 70's, (..not 1980's and 90's...). Explain why these are good examples. Then list 2 more images of examples of technology that embody the authors ideas of how interfaces are today. Again, explain why these are good examples. Please include images and text description for each example you are referring to. 3 images minimum per person. Share these images as a group in discord, and then publish your images on your readings website.

       In the 1950’s-60’s, Singer released sewing machines that expanded upon the classic straight stitch. Singer allowed more options for stitch width and tension, as well as creating the zig-zag stick that is used in garments today. These machines were more compact and portable compared to the original tabletop machines.

       Another technological advancement from the 50’s was the invention of the modem. The modem was used as a communication device. The US Air Force used it as a way to transmit radar images to command. These days, the modem is still used to covert data into transmission medium.

       One example of technology that embodies modern interface is the Google Home system. Google Home involves a large group of products that ultimately play the same role of improving daily life at home. The design of the Google Home speakers is extremely minimalistic, involving no buttons on the whole speaker. The surface of the speaker is used for an option of manual control. Otherwise, the common way to use these products is through vocal commands.

       Another example of modern tech is the touchscreen on modern cars. Car manufacturers are coming up with new ways to reinvent the driving experience. On many cars, this green is simply used for radio and clock functions. More and more cars are coming with options for internal GPS and even entertainment.

       <h3>
       Q6. As a group, please come up with examples of two different kind of technology that normally don't have this interface design or 'consideration' mentioned in the reading and podcast, but could benefit from this 'theatrifaction' or 'gamification' idea of its interface. Please describe what would you suggest doing to it to change it.
       </h3>
       <p>
       I think there should be more technology for assistance on house plants. Keeping plants is a growing hobby amongst people who spend much time at home. Currently, accessible technology for houseplant keepers is limited to monitors for light, moisture, and humidity. A great technological advancement would be systems that could assist in taking care of plants. For example, if a plant is severely underwater, the machine could provide water for them. This is also good for people who travel since many plants are high demand and need daily care.
